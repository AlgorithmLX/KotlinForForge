# thedarkcolour.kotlinforforge.kotlin
Since 1.2.2, Kotlin for Forge includes a few extra functions for creating
collections that are less common than those in ``Collections.kt``.

This package contains various utility functions that aren't really 
related to Minecraft or Minecraft forge, but are still useful in some cases.
