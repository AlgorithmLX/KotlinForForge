## Kotlin for Forge Maven
Hello there! This here is the Maven repository holding every published version of KFF.
It is not a traditional Maven, here are the steps to publishing a new version:

1. Ensure that this "site" project folder is in a folder which also contains a project 
 folder for a buildable branch of Kotlin for Forge (Ex. a folder called "projects" which 
contains "website" folder for the "site" branch and "KotlinForForge" for the "4.x" branch)

2. Run update_maven.jl with Julia
```shell
julia update_maven.jl <kff mod branch folder>
```
